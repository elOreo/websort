        <h3>How to use:</h3>
        <ul class= "helpList">
            <li>1. Use the slider to select a number of random sized fields.</li>
            <li>2. Click on 'New Set' to generate the fields in a random size.</li>
            <li>3. Use the Buttons in the top right (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort or Quick Sort) and see how the before generated fields are getting sorted based on their size.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bubble Sort:</h4>
        <p class= "helpPara">
          Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
        </p>
        <h4>Insertion Sort:</h4>
        <p class= "helpPara">
          Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
        </p>
        <h4>Merge Sort:</h4>
        <p class= "helpPara">
          In computer science, merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.
        </p>
        <h4>Quick Sort:</h4>
        <p class= "helpPara">
          Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.[4] The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
